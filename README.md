# SQL Database Design & Implemetation Task

In this project I:
* Used UML notation to design an Entity-Relation Diagram
* Documented and justified my design decisions
* Created a Relational model from my ER diagram
* Specified my Primary & Foreign keys
* Implemented my DB using MySQL
* Tested and validated my system with query statements

The file *ticket_design.pdf* documents my ERD as well as justification for the elements.

The script *ticket_init.sql* initialises the database, the *ticket_query.sql* and *ticket_update.sql* scripts demonstrate the function of the DB.

I completed this project whilst undertaking the ECM2419 module at the University of Exeter - full PDF specification can be found in *specification.pdf*
